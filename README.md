[Red It](http://red-it.herokuapp.com) is a super-lightweight reddit clone. 

## Usage
/r/news is the default subreddit, and other subreddits may be added as long as they exist. If a particular subreddit doesn't exist, the user won't be able to add it. Finally, subreddits may be deleted from the "Included subreddits" list simply by clicking on them. 

To run a local copy of Red It, clone this repo, and in the project directory, run:
### `npm start`
